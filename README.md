This repository contains a sample implementation of a gRPC server using .NET Core. The project demonstrates how to build a simple, yet robust, gRPC service that can handle client requests efficiently. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as bi-directional streaming.



Getting Started:

1.Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/robinyoung057/GRPCServerExample.git

2.Navigate to the Project Directory:

    cd GRPCServerExample

3.Restore Dependencies:

    dotnet restore
    
4.Run the gRPC Server:

    dotnet run

5.Testing the Server: Use a gRPC client, such as the one provided in the example or any other gRPC-compatible client, to test the server's functionality.

Prerequisites:

  .NET Core SDK: Make sure you have .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
  gRPC Tools: Ensure you have the necessary tools to compile and run gRPC services.
